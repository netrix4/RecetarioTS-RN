        "Ingredients": "Sushi rice (approximately 150-200 grs. per diner), Rice vinegar, Nori seaweed sheets, Soy sauce, Wasabi, Fish filling: salmon/tuna/surimi sticks/cooked shrimp/mackerel… (approximately 100-150 gr. per diner), Vegetable-fruit filling: cucumber/carrot/avocado/mango…, It is not an ingredient in itself, but we need a bamboo mat as material to roll the sushi rolls",
        "Recipe": "The first thing we will do is put the rice in a strainer and rinse it several times with very cold water, until it comes out clear, to remove all the starch. When it is ready, we boil it using the same amount of water as rice. First, we put the rice on medium heat for a couple of minutes and then we lower the heat to minimum and let it boil for 10 minutes. It is important that the pot is covered throughout the cooking process. After this time, we remove the pot from the heat and let the rice rest, uncovered, for another 15 minutes. While the rice rests, we prepare the sushi-zu, which is the vinegar dressing that we will add later. The mixture is made up of rice vinegar, sugar and salt, in a proportion of 5:2:1, that is, for every five parts of vinegar, we put two of sugar and one of salt. We need sushi-zu in a ratio of 1:5, that is, one part of seasoning for every five parts of dry rice that we have boiled. To prepare it, we heat the vinegar slightly in a saucepan, dissolve the sugar and salt in it and let it cool.Once the rice and the mixture are ready, we spread the boiled rice on a tray or container, preferably made of wood, and mix it with the seasoning that we have made using a wooden paddle. While we mix it, we fan the rice so that it is at room temperature. To prepare the filling, we cut the Ingredients that we have chosen into thin longitudinal strips that are as similar as possible. The fish can be raw (preferably previously frozen for safety), marinated, or semi-cooked, to taste, and the vegetables are usually added raw. Once we have the rice seasoned on one side, and the filling on the other, it is time to assemble the rolls. To make the rolls, spread the bamboo mat on a flat surface and cover it with plastic wrap. Place a sheet of nori on top with the shiniest side facing down and the stripes perpendicular to you. With your hands moistened with water, take rice and spread it evenly, creating a layer of rice about a centimetre thick and leaving a centimetre gap at the top edge of the nori (the area furthest from you). Once the base is prepared, place the filling in the centre of the bottom of the nori. As a variation, if you want to make a sushi roll with rice on the outside (uramaki) and coated with sesame seeds, make the filling in another way: with the rice placed on the nori, turn it over and put the filling directly on the seaweed. homemade-sushi-mat To form the roll, with a quick movement, take the bottom part of the mat and wrap the Ingredients and rice in it, making a roll, while pressing lightly. The roll will reach the space of seaweed that we have left without rice, and it is there where we seal it to the roll by moistening it a little. Once this is done, we cut the roll in one firm stroke into 6-8 portions with a very sharp and slightly wet knife, so as not to break it. We prepare the soy sauce and wasabi to season and moisten the pieces, and the ginger if we want to change from one flavor to another"

Once the rice has finished cooking, leave it in a bowl covered with a damp cloth so that it does not dry out until it cools. Meanwhile, heat the water and salt in a saucepan until it dissolves. When the salt water cools, wet your hands in it so that the rice does not stick to it when you work with it. Prepare the different types of fillings that you want to taste. To add the filling, put a good spoonful of rice on one hand. Put the filling in the center of it. Next, you will have to finish forming the ball, completely covering the filling. Finally, give it a triangular shape (with rounded corners). You must press the ball thoroughly so that it remains compact.

Allow two pieces per person Onion or spring onion Sunflower oil. If you use olive oil, choose a mild one Toasted sesame seeds Soy sauce Mirin Sake Sugar Long-grain rice",
        "Recipe": "We'll start by preparing the teriyaki sauce. In a saucepan, put 100 ml of soy sauce, 45 ml of sake, 40 ml of mirin and two tablespoons of sugar. Reduce the sauce over low heat until it has a consistency similar to that of liquid caramel. If it doesn't stay thick, you can add corn starch to help. If you like it sweeter you can always add more sugar or mirin. With this you would have the basic sauce, but you can customize it by adding ground ginger, lemon or orange zest or finely chopped garlic. And what happens if I can't find mirin or sake? You can substitute them with local Ingredients, but the result will not be exactly the same. You can replace the sake with semi-dry white wine and the mirin with a sweet sherry. If you only have sake, add a little more sugar and that's it. Once the sauce is prepared, set aside. In a saucepan with water and salt, boil the rice for the garnish. Use basmati rice or steamed rice to make it looser. Cover the bottom of a frying pan with sunflower oil and heat over high heat. Cut the onion or spring onion into julienne strips and add to the pan when the oil is very hot. Cut the thighs into medium pieces and add them to the onion so they brown on the outside. When the chicken has that golden colour that we all like, add the teriyaki sauce to the pan and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. You will see how the sauce sticks to the meat, giving it an irresistible shine. Serve the chicken with its rice garnish and, if you want, decorate with some toasted sesame seeds."

To serve the salmon, present it on a platter or plate, accompanied by 20 ml of soy sauce or ponzu sauce, 5 g of pickled ginger and 1 teaspoon of wasabi paste."

        "Ingredients": "filling:80-100mL of whipping cream, 1cs of sugar (15g), 4-5 strawberries dough: 5cs of glutinous rice flour (75g)2cs of sugar (30g) 90-100mL of water approx.Colorant (optional)Fine corn flour (to flour the dough)",
        "Recipe": "First, cut about 4-5 strawberries into small cubes. Next, put about 80-100mL of cold whipping cream in a bowl and add 1 tbsp of sugar. Beat well until you see that the cream is whipped and no longer has a liquid consistency (if you do it with a whisk mixer it will be much faster and easier). Add the strawberries you just cut to the bowl of cream and mix gently. Be careful not to mix too much so that the cream does not lose its creaminess. Take the filling and try to make 6-8 small balls with the help of a couple of spoons. Put these strawberry and cream balls in the freezer for 1 hour so that they are well frozen.When the filling has been in the freezer for almost 1 hour, you can start making the mochi dough. Although it may seem difficult at first glance, making the mochi dough is not complicated at all. Add 5 tbsp of glutinous rice flour and 2 tbsp of sugar to a bowl. Add water little by little (about 90-100mL in total) while stirring with a spoon until you get a consistency similar to that of liquid yogurt. Next, to get the typical consistency of this Japanese sweet, you will have to heat the dough in the microwave in intervals (put the bowl in the microwave with a plate on top to cover it) and mix it between intervals, like this: Heat the dough for 1 minute and stir well for 1 minute.Heat the dough for 1 more minute and mix it again for another minute. Heat the dough for 30 seconds and stir well again. Heat the dough for another 30 seconds, mix again and it should be ready.To make these strawberry mochis, wait for the dough to cool a little, flour it (with cornstarch or fine corn flour) and cut it into 6-8 pieces (depending on the size you want them to be). Flatten each piece of dough and try to make them into a circle.  Take the strawberry and cream balls out of the freezer, flour the dough with cornstarch and fill each piece of dough with one of these balls.Join all the parts of the mochi dough in the center until it is well closed.  Do this with all the pieces of dough and all the balls until you have created all the Japanese mochis. Leave them at room temperature so that the mochi filling defrosts and becomes creamy."

On the table, place the dish with all the Ingredients and the stove with the broth heating up. Beat one raw egg per person and serve in a bowl. In another bowl, serve boiled rice to accompany. Once the broth boils, lower the heat and add some vegetable Ingredients (but not the meat). Let them cook over medium heat and when you think they are ready, take them out with chopsticks and dip them in beaten egg before tasting.  The meat cooks in just a few seconds, so you shouldn't leave it in the broth for too long. If you do, it will be hard and won't be as tasty.
